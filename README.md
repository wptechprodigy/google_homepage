This is my journey through the Odin Project.

This demonstrates my knowledge of using git to:

Creating a New Repository on GitHub, cloning it using git
and working on it on Termux.

I have created this README.md file using `touch` (obvious)
and edited it on Termux using vim.

I'll then add it to the Staging Area. Then Commit it to the Repo.
