This is my journey through the Odin Project.

This demonstrates my knowledge of using git.

I created a New Repository on GitHub, clone it using git
and work on it on Termux.

I created this README.md file using `touch` (obvious)
and edited it on Termux using vim.

I'll then add it to the Staging Area. Then Commit it to the Repo.
